### Zifu's Portfolio

Hi there! My name is Zifu. I am a full-stack frontend developer who likes tinkering with many programming langauges. I am currently studying in Hong Kong, and learning many different langauges such as Python, Lua, Javascript, HTML, Typescript, and C#. Feel free to look around my profile (even though I might not currently have much to showcase) and take inspiration from any code you find interesting (with credit!)
